CRUD Operation:
    GET: retrieve resources
    POST: submit new data to the server
    PUT: update existing data
    PATCH: update existing data partially
    DELETE: remove data


CREATING RESTful APIs:
    GET: 
        /posts -> to get data for all posts
    POST: 
        /posts -> to add a new post
    GET: 
        /posts/:id -> to get one post
    PATCH: 
        /posts/:id -> to update specific post
    DELETE: 
        /posts/:id -> to delete specific post
