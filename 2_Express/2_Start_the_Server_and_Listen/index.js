// In Express.js, a port is a specific communication endpoint that allows the server(backend) to listen for and handle incoming requests.

// A port is like a door where the server listens for requests.

})

// After running it in the terminal,  
// search localhost:3000 on Google,  
// and you'll see  ->   Cannot GET /  
// because the server is only listening but not sending any response.
