node_modules: node_modules is a folder that stores all the installed dependencies (packages) for a project.
How it works:
    When you run "npm install <package>" → It downloads the package and stores it in node_modules.
    It also installs any dependencies required by that package.
    The node_modules folder is automatically created in the project.




package-lock.json: It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including it's sub-dependencies and their versions.





package.json: package.json is a file that contains metadata about a project and manages its dependencies.
Purpose:
    Defines project details (name, version, description).
    Lists dependencies and devDependencies.
    Helps npm manage and install packages consistently.
Use Cases:
    npm install → Installs dependencies listed in package.json


If node_modules gets deleted by mistake, you can recover it using:
Steps to Recover:
    Open terminal in the project directory.
    Run:
        npm install
    This will:
        Read package.json and package-lock.json
        Reinstall all listed dependencies into node_modules

Why It Works:
package.json defines the required dependencies.
npm install downloads and restores them.
